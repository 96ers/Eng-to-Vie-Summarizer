Heavy rains and strong winds over the course of two days, along with tornadoes, caused heavy damage to many states. Sadly, 85-year-old Albert Barnett and his wife, 75-year-old Susan Barnett, were killed when a tornado struck their homes. The United States branch reports that at least four of our brothers\' homes and two Kingdom Halls sustained minor damage. In addition, the hurricanes caused major damage to a brother\'s business. Local elders and neighborhood overseers are providing spiritual and material assistance to our affected brothers and sisters. We are confident that the Heavenly Father, Jehovah, is comforting our grieving brothers and sisters. International government officials and agencies have spoken out on Russia\'s ruling banning worship of Jehovah\'s Witnesses in Russia. Commentaries have criticized Russia for its harsh and unjust judicial actions against a small religious group known to operate peacefully. On July17, 2017, a three-judge panel of the Appellate Chamber of the Supreme Court of Russia upheld its April20 ruling ""to close the religious organization known as the  Administrative Center of Jehovah\'s Witnesses in Russia \'and its local religious affiliates, and confiscate all property of the organization."" With this ruling, the Supreme Court banned the worship of Jehovah\'s Witnesses throughout Russia.']",5.583148002624512,1475
1,"['en: The Court of Appeals for the Russian Supreme Court upheld its April20 ruling, followed by excerpts of comments made after July17,2017: We are deeply concerned by the Russian Supreme Court\'s decision to dismiss the appeal of Jehovah\'s Witnesses against their charge of ""extremism."" The ruling confirms the unauthorised worship in the peace of 175,000 Russian citizens, and thus their violation of religious freedom enshrined in the Russian Constitution.']",2.3247077465057373,462
2,"['en: I am deeply concerned that the court upheld the ban on Jehovah\'s Witnesses in Russia. Although we petitioned different levels, the ban makes it a crime to enjoy freedom of religion and freedom of thought in peace. - Mr. Gernot Erler, Coordinator for Russia\'s Society for Social Cooperation, Central Asia, and Eastern European Partnership countries, and the German Foreign Ministry. Russia\'s recent inhumane decision to ban Jehovah\'s Witnesses, not to recognize them as a religious organization in Russia, is a complete violation of the protection of freedom of religion and belief enshrined in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Those with good will from all religious organizations and those who value freedom of conscience must unite with Jehovah\'s Witnesses in Russia. - Dr. Katrina Lantos Swett, president of the Lantos organization. Before the Appeals Court handed down the verdict, many government agencies and officials condemned the Russian Supreme Court ruling of April 20: ""I have asked President Vladimir Putin to use his influence to protect the rights of minorities in this country as well as of Jehovah\'s Witnesses."" - Angela Merkel, the German prime minister, in a press conference with President Putin. ""The Supreme Court\'s recent ruling declared the Administrative Center of Jehovah\'s Witnesses in the Russian Federation an extremist organization, and closed it along with 395 local religious organizations of Jehovah\'s Witnesses. This ruling raises much anxiety about religious freedom in Russia, and is another example of the abuse of anti-extremism legislation to deprive them of freedom of speech and assembly."" - Mrs. Theodora Bakoyannis and Mrs. Liliane Maury Pasquier, two rapporteurs of the Parliamentary Supervisory Committee of the European Commission for the Russian Federation.']",6.998057842254639,1845
3,"['en: Russia\'s failure to respect religious freedom is an act that cannot be justified in violating Moscow\'s OSCE commitments. Those who practice their faith peacefully should not be mistreated, fined, or imprisoned. The court\'s decision to confiscate the property of Jehovah\'s Witnesses would only cause further harm to the Witnesses. I hope that this case will be brought to the European Court of Human Rights. ""Senator Roger Wicker, chair of the Committee for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Yesterday\'s ruling by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation banned the activities of the Administrative Center of Jehovah\'s Witnesses, which it said was ""extremist,"" and could cause Jehovah\'s Witnesses to begin to be convicted solely for their worship activities. Like all religions, Jehovah\'s Witnesses must be free to assemble peacefully and unhindered, as provided for in the Constitution of the Russian Federation and in Russia\'s international commitments and international human rights standards. I am concerned by the unjust conviction of Jehovah\'s Witnesses\' peaceful activities in Russia, and the abolition of the organization as an entity within the country. The court\'s ruling threatens the values and principles that underlie democratic, liberal, open, tolerant, and multicultural societies."" Michael Georg Link, head of the OSCE\'s Office on Democracy and Human Rights. The prohibition leads to the arrest of peaceful people for their worship activities, and clearly violates fundamental religious freedom and international human rights standards also enshrined in the Constitution of the Russian Federation. Therefore, it is necessary to make the adjustment as soon as possible.

4,"['en: I am deeply concerned about the Russian Supreme Court\'s ruling that Jehovah\'s Witnesses are ""extremists."" The ruling makes peaceful worship of 175,000 Russian citizens illegal and contrary to the freedom of religion enshrined in the Constitution of Russia. The United Kingdom urges the Russian government to maintain its international commitment to this fundamental freedom. - Baroness Joyce Anelay, former state secretary of state of the Commonwealth and the United Nations in the Foreign Office. On July20, 2017, the Permanent Council of the OSCE adopted the European Union (EU) statement. The statement called for Russia to allow Jehovah\'s Witnesses ""to assemble in peace without interference, as enshrined in the Constitution of the Russian Federation as well as its international commitment and international human rights standards."" The statement was unanimously adopted by all 28 EU member states in Vienna, and by other non-EU states such as Australia, Canada, and Norway. Jehovah\'s Witnesses worldwide are dismayed by the authoritarian ruling. The Russian Supreme Court has banned the worship of Jehovah\'s Witnesses throughout the country. Through its comments, international government agencies and officials have condemned Russia for unjustly declaring Jehovah\'s Witnesses to be ""extremists,"" and for ignoring its own constitution and international commitment to protect freedom of religion. The case will go to the European Court of Human Rights and it is hoped that the prohibition in this country will be lifted. Lifetime employment for state officials will be lifted from today.

Besides this, under the amended law, indefinite-term labor contracts will remain with those recruited before July 1,2020, civil servants who are transferred to civil servant and public employee positions working in extremely difficult socio-economic conditions. For civil servants who were recruited before July 1 but have not yet signed indefinite-term contracts, they have the right to sign contracts with indefinite terms after completing their contracts under the amended law. To ensure the interests of civil servants who sign indefinite-term labor contracts, the amended law also stipulates that leaders of state units or organizations must continue to sign or terminate labor contracts with employees 60 days before the expiration of their contracts.

Completed the dismantling of Binh Trieu tollbooths in Saigon As of Monday afternoon, November 2, the HCMC government had completed the dismantling of Binh Trieu 1 Bridge and Binh Trieu Bridge 2 tollbooth in Thu Duc District, after four years of inactivity. The HCMC Infrastructure Investment Company, the investor of the build-operate-transfer (BOT) project of Binh Trieu Bridge - phase 1, put the tollbooths into operation in 2005 and closed in 2016. The company maintains the tollbooths rather than dismantling them as it plans to use them for the Binh Trieu Bridge project - phase 2. However, the municipal government decided to suspend the BOT project of Binh Trieu Bridge - phase 2 in 2017 so the tollbooths have not operated since.']",7.711406469345093,1564
7,"['en: The inactivity of toll booths has been identified as one of the causes of traffic congestion in the city, especially during peak hours. Accidents happen due to these toll booths because drivers lose focus on hitting them. Following a proposal from the HCMC Department of Transport, in July 2020, the Road Management Center was tasked with dismantling toll booths to reduce traffic congestion in the area. Fifteen Chinese and Vietnamese crew members are missing after the Panama ship sank near the central coast The rescuers are searching for 15 Chinese and Vietnamese crew members on a Panama ship that sank off Binh Thuan Province today, December 17. The ship carrying clay from Malaysia to Hong Kong, in Binh Thuan waters, said the border guard of Phu Quy Island at 4: 30 p. m., when the captain contacted border guard forces of Phu Quy Island to report that the ship was tilted due to clay leaning on one side of the ship. Fifteen crew members - 11 Chinese and 4 Vietnamese - were on board. But when it was about 1.5 nautical miles from Phu Quy Port, the ship tilted and sank. Emergency signals for rescue were continuously sent from that time. Binh Thuan border guard forces and Phu Quy Search and Rescue Station mobilized ships to the scene to rescue the crew members. But no one was found at 6: 30 p. m. Despite rough seas and strong winds near the island, the search is still ongoing. The search radius has been expanded from 3 to 5 nautical miles from the accident scene, and additional ships have been deployed.']",6.452715873718262,1528
8,"[""en: There seem to be fascinating myths and superstitions in every aspect of life, including physical ones. For example, the mole is considered evidence of guilt in the Salem witch trials. For Chinese people, the shape of your nose is supposed to reveal whether you will be rich or not. There are also a number of fascinating myths about our current topic: birthmarks. Birthmarks are not an uncommon phenomenon. In fact, about 80 percent of us are born with these seemingly random birthmarks on our bodies. There are many different birthmarks. Besides brown birthmarks like moles and café au lait spots, there are reddish birthmarks that vary in color and shape, from tiny pink marks on the skin to dark red, raised ones. All of these reddish birthmarks are caused by blood vessels that are near the surface of the skin and are visible. Although we know that blood vessels form birthmarks, we don't know what causes them. And this is where all the myths, the vague speculation, and the fascinating superstitions begin. First, the legend of the mother's mark. The theory is that if a woman experiences a particularly strong emotion during pregnancy, the baby may have a birthmark.""]",4.439162969589233,1182
9,"[""en: Not only that, if a woman touched a particular part of her body while experiencing emotions, that would be where birthmarks would appear on the body of the child. Meanwhile, according to Iranian legend, it is believed that if a woman touched her belly while watching an eclipse, the baby might also have - you guessed it - a birthmark. Other intriguing myths revolve around the color of food. For example, if the baby had a red birthmark, it was thought to be because the mother wanted to eat strawberries during pregnancy. But if the mother wanted to eat jello or beets, the baby would have a wine birthmark. And it seems that a craving for chocolate would cause the child to have coffee-brown birthmarks. Besides being the result of pregnancy cravings and watching an eclipse, birthmarks are thought to be omens about one's life. For example, if you had a birthmark on your right arm, you would definitely be wealthy; if it was on your left arm, you would be penniless. In other regions, a birthmark on your left leg means that the person would be extremely intelligent, while if it was on his right leg, he would enjoy exploration, adventure and travel. Some birthmarks are also thought to relate to how you died in a previous life. How frightening, right? Whether you believe these things or not, they are fascinating to learn - and exploitable.""]",5.170455455780029,1357
