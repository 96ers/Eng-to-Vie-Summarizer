0," Brother Albert Barnett and his wife, Sister Susan Barnett, from the West Congregation in Tuscaloosa, Alabama Severe storms ripped through parts of the southern and midwestern United States on January 11 and 12, 2020. Two days of heavy rain, high winds, and numerous tornadoes caused major damage across multiple states. Sadly, Brother Albert Barnett and his wife, Sister Susan Barnett, 85 and 75 years old respectively, were killed when a tornado struck their mobile home. The United States branch also reports that at least four of our brothers' homes sustained minor damage, along with two Kingdom Halls. Additionally, the storms caused major damage to a brother's business property. Local elders and the circuit overseer are offering practical and spiritual support to those affected by this disaster. We know that our heavenly Father, Jehovah, is providing comfort to our brothers and sisters who are grieving because of this tragedy. International government agencies and officials have responded to Russia's Supreme Court decision that criminalizes the worship of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia. These statements have criticized Russia's unjust and harsh judicial action against a minority religious group known for peaceful religious activity. On July 17, 2017, a three - judge panel of the Appellate Chamber of Russia's Supreme Court upheld the Court's April 20 decision ""to liquidate the religious organization 'Administrative Center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia' and the local religious organizations that are part of its structure to turn over to the Russian Federation all property of the liquidated religious organization."""
1,"With this decision, the Court effectively banned the worship of Jehovah's Witnesses throughout Russia. The following are excerpts of statements made after the July 17, 2017, decision by the Appellate Chamber of Russia's Supreme Court to uphold the April 20 ruling: We are deeply concerned by the decision of Russia's Supreme Court to reject the appeal of the Jehovah's Witnesses against their labelling as' extremists. ' This ruling confirms the criminalisation of the peaceful worship of 175.000 Russian citizens and contravenes the right to religious freedom that is enshrined in the Russian Constitution. - Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, Minister for Human Rights, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Great Britain. The Russian Supreme Court's decision this week against the Jehovah's Witnesses is the latest in a disturbing trend of persecution of religious minorities in Russia. We urge the Russian authorities to lift the ban on Jehovah's Witnesses' activities in Russia, to reverse the closing of the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center, and to release any members of religious minorities that continue to be unjustly detained for so - called 'extremist' activities. - Heather Nauert, Department Spokesperson for the U.S.Department of State. ""Jehovah's Witnesses, like all other religious groups, must be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, as well as by Russia's international commitments and international human rights standards."" - Spokesperson for the European Union External Action Services. The Supreme Court's decision sadly reflects the government's continued equating of peaceful religious freedom practice to extremism."
2,"The Witnesses are not an extremist group, and should be able to practice their faith openly and freely and without government repression. - Daniel Mark, Chairman of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom. I am very concerned by the fact that the court ban on Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia has been upheld. Despite our appeals on a number of levels, this move makes the peaceful enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion and thought a criminal offence. - Gernot Erler, Coordinator for Intersocietal Cooperation With Russia, Central Asia, and the Eastern Partnership Countries, Foreign Ministry of Germany. Russia's recent outrageous decision to ban the Jehovah's Witnesses from existing as a recognized faith community in Russia is a complete violation of the protections for freedom of religion and belief in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. People of goodwill from all faith communities as well as all those who cherish freedom of conscience rights must stand in solidarity with the Jehovah's Witnesses of Russia. - Dr.Katrina Lantos Swett, president, Lantos Foundation. Prior to the Appellate Chamber's decision, numerous government agencies and officials condemned the Russian Supreme Court's April 20 ruling: ""I asked President Vladimir Putin to use his influence to guarantee minority rights here as well as with Jehovah's witnesses."" - Chancellor Angela Merkel, during a news conference with President Putin."
3,"""The recent decision of the Supreme Court to declare the Jehovah's Witnesses Administrative Center in the Russian Federation an extremist organisation, and to close it down, together with the 395 Local Religious Organisations used by Witnesses, raises serious concerns regarding freedom of religion in Russia and is another example of the legislation against extremism being abused to curtail freedom of expression and assembly."" - Theodora Bakoyannis and Liliane Maury Pasquier, co-rapporteurs of the PACE Monitoring Committee for the Russian Federation. Russia's failure to respect religious freedom is yet another inexcusable violation of Moscow's OSCE commitments. People who practice their faith peacefully should never be in danger of being harassed, fined, or jailed. The court order to seize organization property owned by Jehovah's Witnesses adds insult to injury. I am hopeful that this case will be appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. - Senator Roger Wicker, Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. Yesterday's decision of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation to ban the activities of the Administrative Centre of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia on grounds of 'extremism' could make it possible to launch criminal prosecutions against Jehovah's Witnesses for mere acts of worship. Jehovah's Witnesses, like all other religious groups, must be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation as well as by Russia's international commitments and international human rights standards."
4,"I'm deeply concerned by this unwarranted criminalization of the peaceful activities of members of the Jehovah's Witnesses communities in Russia, eliminating this community as a viable entity in the country. This Supreme Court decision poses a threat to the values and principles that democratic, free, open, pluralistic and tolerant societies rest upon. - Michael Georg Link, Director of the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. This ban persecuting peaceful persons for mere acts of worship clearly violates the fundamental right to religious freedom and with it international human rights standards as also guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation. It therefore needs to be revised as soon as possible. - Professor Ingeborg Gabriel, Personal Representative of the OSCE Chairperson - in - Office on Combating Racism, Xenophobia, and Discrimination. I am alarmed by the decision of Russia's Supreme Court to recognise the Jehovah's Witnesses as' extremists'. This ruling effectively criminalizes the peaceful worship of 175,000 Russian citizens and contravenes the right to religious freedom which is enshrined in the Russian Constitution. The UK calls on the Russian government to uphold its international commitment to this basic freedom. - Baroness Joyce Anelay, former Minister of State for the Commonwealth and the UN at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. On July 20, 2017, the Permanent Council of the OSCE adopted a statement from the European Union (EU)."
5,"The statement calls on Russia to allow Jehovah's Witnesses to ""be able to peacefully enjoy freedom of assembly without interference, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the Russian Federation as well as by Russia's international commitments and international human rights standards."" The statement was unanimously adopted in Vienna by all 28 member states of the EU, and other non-EU member countries such as Australia, Canada, and Norway have aligned themselves with it. Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide are deeply disappointed that with its arbitrary decision, Russia's Supreme Court has effectively banned their worship throughout the country. In their responses, international government agencies and officials expose Russia for unjustly declaring Jehovah's Witnesses ""extremists"" and for ignoring its own constitutional and international commitments to protect religious freedom. The European Court of Human Rights has yet to hear this matter and will hopefully reverse the nationwide ban. Lifetime employment for public employees abolished from today The amended and supplemented Law on Cadres and Civil Servants and the revised Law on Public Employees will take effect from today, July 1, with the lifetime employment policy for State employees eliminated. Under the amended laws, public employees who were recruited today, July 1, will sign labor contracts with a definite term instead of the previous indefinite one. The term of labor contracts extends up to five years, up two years against the previous term, Thanh Nien newspaper reported."
6,"Besides this, in line with the amended laws, the signing of indefinite - term labor contracts will remain as is for those who were recruited prior to July 1, 2020, civil servants being moved to public employee positions and public employees who are working in extremely difficult socio - economic conditions. As for public employees who were employed before July 1 but were yet to sign an indefinite - term contract, they are entitled to sign contracts with an indefinite term after finishing their contracts in line with the revised laws. To guarantee the benefits of public employees signing definite - term labor contracts, the amended laws also regulate that leaders of State units or organizations must continue to sign or terminate a labor contract with employees 60 days prior to the expiration date of the contract. V - pop prince's documentary soundtrack among global music charts The soundtrack to pop star Son Tung's documentary has topped Vietnam's iTunes charts, entering the top 10 in several other countries following domestic release. The ""Sky Tour"" track was in 83rd position on the international iTunes chart earlier this week. The original soundtrack (OST) of the document about the pop star is # 5 on Itunes in the Czech Republic, # 6 in Singapore and # 10 in Australia. ""SKY TOUR Movie"" features eight songs performed by Son Tung at live shows in Hanoi, Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh City last year, and was released simultaneously with the theatrical release of the documentary on June 12."
7,"At 26, Son Tung already has a slew of hits as well as many accolades, including an MTV Europe Music Award and inclusion in the 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 list in Vietnam. His music videos attract millions of views because of their high - quality visuals and artistry. His latest MV with Snoop Dogg recently hit the 100 million mark on YouTube. Asian publications showered him with praise for achieving this feat. Newspapers in South Korea, home to the world - famous K - pop, like CcDailyNews, Stardailynews and Sportsseoul have dubbed him Vietnam's ""number one artist."" Dismantling Saigon's Binh Trieu tollgates finished As of Monday afternoon, November 2, the HCMC authorities finished dismantling the Binh Trieu 1 Bridge and Binh Trieu 2 Bridge tollgates in Thu Duc District, which had been nonoperational for four years. The HCMC Infrastructure Investment Company, investor of the build - operate - transfer (BOT) Binh Trieu Bridge â€“ phase 1 project, put the tollgates into operation in 2005 and shut them down in 2016. The company maintained the tollgates instead of removing them as it planned to use them for the Binh Trieu Bridge â€“ phase 2 project. However, the city authorities decided to suspend the BOT Binh Trieu Bridge â€“ phase 2 project in 2017, therefore the tollgates had been left nonoperational since then. The nonoperational tollgates were identified as one of the causes of traffic congestion in the city, especially during rush hours. Accidents have been caused by the tollgates as distracted drivers crashed into them."
8,"Following the suggestion of the HCMC Department of Transport, in July 2020 the Roads Management Center has been assigned to the task of removing the tollgates in order to reduce traffic congestion in the area. 15 Chinese, Vietnamese crew missing after Panamanian vessel sinks near central coast Rescue forces are searching for 15 Chinese and Vietnamese crew of a Panamanian ship that sank off Binh Thuan Province today, December 17th. The ship, carrying clay from Malaysia to Hong Kong, was in the Binh Thuan sea area at 4:30 p.m. when its captain contacted border guard forces of Phu Quy Island to inform them that the vessel was tilting due to the clay leaning on one side of the ship, the Binh Thuan border guard force said. Fifteen crew members â€“ 11 Chinese and four Vietnamese â€“ were on board. But while it was about 1.5 nautical miles away from the Phu Quy Port, the ship tilted hard and sank. Emergency signals for rescue were continually broadcast from that point. The Binh Thuan border defense force and the Phu Quy search and rescue station dispatched ships to the scene to rescue the crew members. But no one was found as of 6:30 p.m. Despite rough seas and strong winds near the island, the search is ongoing. The search radius has been expanded to three to five nautical miles from the scene of the accident, and additional ships have been deployed. There seem to be myths and superstitions about nearly every aspect of life, and this includes physical attributes. Moles, for example, were considered evidence of guilt during the Salem Witch Trials."
9,"And among the Chinese, the shape of your nose is said to reveal whether or not you will be wealthy. There are also a host of fascinating myths about our present topic: birthmarks. Birthmarks are n't exactly a rare phenomenon. In fact, about 80% of us are born with these seemingly random markings on our bodies. There are several different kinds of birthmarks. As well as brown pigmented types of birthmarks like moles and cafÃ© au lait spots, there are reddish vascular types ranging in color and form from tiny, pink marks that are flush with the skin, to dark red puffy sorts. All these reddish (vascular) markings are caused by blood vessels that lie close to the surface of the skin and show through. Even though we know that the blood vessel - clumping makes a birthmark, we do n't know why this happens in the first place. And this is where all the myth, mysticism and juicy superstition comes in. First on the docket is the maternal impression myth. This theory suggests that if a woman experiences an especially strong emotion during pregnancy, her baby may be born with a birthmark. Not only that, but if the woman touches a particular location on her body while experiencing the emotion, that is where the birthmark will appear on her baby's body. In Iranian lore, meanwhile, it is believed that if a woman touches her stomach while watching a solar eclipse, her baby may well have - you guessed it - a birthmark. Other myths center around the colors of food."
10,"For example, if the baby ends up with a red birthmark, it is supposedly because the mother wanted to eat strawberries while she was pregnant. But, if she wanted to eat jelly or beets, her baby gets a port - wine stain. Chocolate cravings, meanwhile, apparently lead to light brown cafÃ© au lait spots. Beyond being a result of pregnancy cravings and gazing at eclipses, birthmarks are also said to be omens about people's lives. If, for example, you happen to have a birthmark on your right arm, you're sure to be prosperous; but, if it's on your left, you're going to have to pinch some pennies. Elsewhere, a left - foot birthmark means the person will be massively intelligent, while if it's on the right, they'll love exploration, adventure and travel. Some birthmarks are also supposedly linked with your manner of death in a previous life. Is that creepy or what? Whether or not you put any stock in these myths and beliefs, they can certainly be a lot of fun to learn about - and possibly exploit. Inventing a story about your death and reincarnation is sure to be a great conversation piece at dinner parties. Or, you can explain the presence of a certain mark by claiming that your mother desired to stroke a goat with her pinky toe while she pregnant with you. Stranger things have happened. A Governing Body member shares encouraging Scriptural comments, and young ones from around the world share personal expressions. Sorry, the media player failed to load."
11,"Download This Video (New York) Vietnamese authorities have detained, interrogated, and even tortured Montagnard refugees and asylum seekers who have returned to Vietnam from U.N. High Commission for Refugee (UNHCR) camps in Cambodia, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The government is violating an agreement with UNHCR, which is supposed to monitor returning refugees and ensure they are safe. Drawing on eyewitness accounts and published sources, the 55 - page report, ""No Sanctuary: Ongoing Threats to Indigenous Montagnards in Vietnam's Central Highlands,"" provides fresh information about ongoing religious and political persecution of Montagnards, or indigenous communities, in Vietnam's Central Highlands. ""The Vietnamese government continues to persecute Montagnards once they are out of the sight of international observers,"" said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. ""The international community should oppose their forced return to the Central Highlands as long as the authorities continue to persecute them."" Human Rights Watch urged the U.N. High Commission for Refugees to review its participation in promoting and facilitating voluntary repatriation, given the disturbing accounts of mistreatment of returnees, as well as weaknesses in UNHCR's monitoring mechanisms. It also called on the U.S. government to keep Vietnam on its list of ""Countries of Particular Concern"" for religious freedom violations, and urged Cambodia to continue to provide temporary asylum to Montagnards, in line with its obligations as a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention. Vietnamese officials continue to force Montagnard Christians to sign pledges renouncing their religion, despite passage of new regulations last year banning such practices."
12,"Authorities in some areas restrict freedom of movement between villages â€“ in particular for religious purposes not authorized by the government â€“ and ban Christian gatherings in many areas unless they are presided over by officially recognized pastors. More worrisome, the Vietnamese government persists in criminalizing peaceful dissent, unsanctioned religious activity and efforts to seek sanctuary in Cambodia, by arresting and imprisoning Montagnards who engage in those activities. The most harshly treated are evangelical Christians who belong to independent or unregistered house churches and supporters of a non-violent movement for the protection of, and greater control over, ancestral lands. More than 350 Montagnards have been sentenced to prison since 2001, largely for peaceful political or religious activities. Most have been charged under Vietnam's Penal Code with vaguely worded national security crimes. These include ""undermining the unity policy,"" ""disrupting security"" and ""causing public disorder"". More than 60 Montagnards have been imprisoned after being forcibly returned from Cambodia, where they were seeking asylum. The arrests are ongoing: during 2005 alone, at least 142 people â€“ some of whom had been in pre-trial detention for as much as a year â€“ were sentenced to prison terms of up to 17 years. This is more than double the number imprisoned during the previous year. At least 30 of those sentenced in 2005 had been arrested in Cambodia or near the border areas. They were apprehended by Cambodian police and turned over to Vietnamese authorities without having a chance to make an asylum claim with UNHCR. The report includes an annex listing Central Highland prisoners."
13,"""Serious problems persist for Montagnards in the Central Highlands, and the Vietnamese government continues to gloss them over,"" said Adams. For those who think the problems are all in the past, they should think again. The report includes disturbing testimonies from Montagnards who returned to Vietnam in 2005 from U.N. refugee camps in Cambodia, but then ""doubled back"" to Cambodia after undergoing harsh treatment in Vietnam. They describe in detail being detained, interrogated and even tortured upon return to Vietnam. They also tell of being pressured to recant their religion and threatened not to report any abuses to international delegations and U.N. monitors. Despite this, UNHCR has made repeated public statements that returnees are under ""no particular threat or duress,"" and that it has ""no serious concerns"" about the government's treatment of them. Human Rights Watch called on the Vietnamese government to allow UNHCR full and unfettered access to the Central Highlands, as well as private and confidential meetings with local residents and returnees. The government should also ensure that there will be no retaliation against those with whom UNHCR meets, or their family members. ""These eyewitness accounts make it clear that some returnees have been tortured and persecuted for their religious and political beliefs,"" said Adams. We have given this information to UNHCR. But it has continued to send people back without the unfettered and confidential access to returnees it needs to protect them properly."
14,"Returnees interviewed by Human Rights Watch gave precise accounts of serious threats and intimidation by Vietnamese authorities prior to visits by UNHCR monitors, who have often been accompanied by Vietnamese government officials and police, and are unable to meet privately with returnees. Returnees were warned by authorities not to say anything negative to UNHCR officials. One returnee, who had been beaten and pressured to renounce his religion in police custody, told Human Rights Watch, The UN asked about any mistreatment, but I was too afraid to answer. I told them I had not been hit or threatened. I did n't dare tell them I'd been sent to prison, if I told, would have beaten me. ""Meaningful monitoring can not take place in front of Vietnamese officials, or when villagers are threatened not to talk,"" said Adams. The UNHCR monitoring missions and the repatriation program are seriously flawed and need to be reconsidered. These testimonies, which were shown to UNHCR in January 2006, call into question the credibility of its monitoring of returnees and the assumptions on which the memorandum of understanding relating to repatriation is based: that returnees will not be persecuted and that UNHCR will be able to monitor the treatment of returnees to ensure that they are not harmed. More foreign manufacturers turn to Vietnam amid pandemic: JLL With the novel coronavirus pandemic and trade tensions driving the shift of production lines from China to Southeast Asia, Vietnam, in particular, seems to have emerged as an attractive destination for investors and manufacturers alike, according to Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) Vietnam."
15,"The real estate consultancy said in a recent statement that multinational manufacturers have been setting up operations in Vietnam for a number of years and this trend is poised to strengthened. This movement has accelerated over the past 12 - 24 months, with companies looking to diversify their operations and supply chains due to tariffs on goods exported from China to the United States. Stephen Wyatt, Country Head at JLL Vietnam, noted that Vietnam remains a promising market, with a growing trend during the past few years of manufacturing companies looking to set up operations in the country. Industrial park developers remain confident that demand for land will continue to grow and, therefore, land prices are expected to increase, in line with the long - term potential of Vietnam's industrial segment, Wyatt said. Companies looking to diversify their manufacturing portfolios outside China are attracted to Vietnam, thanks to its proximity to China, free trade agreements and the Government's plans to develop Vietnam into a manufacturing hub for Southeast Asia, according to JLL's latest market report. Also, the report noted that the average price of land in northern Vietnam reached US$ 99 per square meter per lease term, up 6.5% year - on - year in the first quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, the figure for the southern region was US$ 101, a year - on - year increase of 12.2%, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. In addition, ready - built factories recorded an average price of US$ 3.5 - 5 per square meter per month in both regions."
16,"Vietnamese man cheats, sending staff to be quarantined in his stead A businessman on the same flight from Hanoi to Hue as Vietnam's 30th Covid - 19 patient sent an employee as his substitute for quarantining. The substitution was only discovered the next morning, Hoang Nam, Vice Chairman of Quang Tri People's Committee said Monday. ""He flew on the same flight with 'patient 30' from Hanoi to Hue,"" Nam said. The unnamed man is the business head of a company that invests in a wind power project in the central province of Quang Tri. After learning of the substitution, authorities requested the man to present himself for quarantine. He has since been quarantined at the Tuberculosis and Lung Specialist Hospital in Dong Ha Town in the province. At 21:30 Friday, four men checked into a hotel in Huong Hoa District, 65 kilometers west of Dong Ha Town. They were identified as co-passengers of Vietnam's 30th Covid - 19 infection on flight VN1547 from Hanoi to Thua - Thien Hue. The men were placed in quarantine Sunday. Authorities only discovered there was a replacement the next morning. Huong Hoa District authorities are tracking down people the men had come in contact with so as to place them in quarantine, too. They will also disinfect places visited by the suspects. The Netherlands invented a record speed wifi router Researchers from the Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands have developed successfully a new equipment that permits to transmit wifi with the speed is 300 times faster than that of the ordinary ones."
17,"This device is expected to bring a revolution in using wifi Internet. According to the researchers, the new wifi router operates based on the principle that in which internet data will be distributed by 'light antenna'. The 'light antenna' mast is responsible for splitting each wavelength of the laser into separate fibers, each fiber can create infrared ray which becomes wifi internet. Professor Ton Koonen, from the University of Science, said, the research team was studying light ray to transmit wifi internet. Ten years ago today, on June 10, 2010, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that Russian authorities had perpetrated a grave violation of human rights with a years - long campaign to suppress our brothers' freedom of worship. The ECHR's judgment directed Russia to pay a sizable fine and to reinstate the registration of the Local Religious Organization of Jehovah's Witnesses in Moscow - which the authorities revoked in 2004. Immediately after the verdict was announced, Brother Ivan Chaykovskiy, then chairman of the Moscow Community of Jehovah's Witnesses, said: This judgment is a victory of common sense over religious intolerance. I hope that as a result of this judgment, the authorities will quickly restore our legal rights and end the nationwide state - sponsored campaign of harassment against Jehovah's Witnesses. That optimism quickly vanished, however, as Russian authorities not only failed to abide by the terms of the ECHR ruling but also escalated their campaign of persecuting our brothers across the federation."
18,"This persecution was dramatically expressed when Russia's Supreme Court effectively banned our peaceful worship in 2017, an injustice that has been followed by numerous arrests, trials, and imprisonments. Although ten years old, much of the Court's stinging judgment against Russia remains relevant. In 2010, the ECHR categorically refuted many of the baseless charges that Russia continues to level against our peaceful fellow believers today. In summary, the ECHR concluded that the Moscow Justice Department, along with the Moscow courts, had 'no legal basis' for refusing the reregistration of Jehovah's Witnesses. The Court decried the Moscow authorities, asserting that they 'did not act in good faith and neglected their duty of neutrality and impartiality.' Additionally, Moscow authorities were guilty of violating the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Russia is a State Party. In 2020, as in 2010, Russia's systemic campaign against our brothers is not going unnoticed. 'For Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia, practicing their faith means risking their freedom,' said Rachel Denber, deputy Europe and Central Asia director for Human Rights Watch. In a statement dated January 9, 2020, she added: 'There is nothing remotely justifiable about this.' In the face of injustice, we pray in full confidence that Jehovah will continue to strengthen our brothers and sisters in Russia to 'endure fully with patience and joy.' 19 overseas returnees take Vietnam's Covid - 19 infections to 233 Vietnam confirmed six more Covid - 19 cases early Friday, five returning from abroad and one related to Hanoi's Bach Mai Hospital."
19,"""Patient 231,"" 57, is an employee of the Truong Sinh Company, the food and logistics provider to Hanoi's Bach Mai Hospital, now the nation's biggest Covid - 19 hotspot. She is a native of Bac Kan, living in the Kim Ngu Commune, Na Ri District. On March 31, she joined a team at the Bach Mai Hospital for a business trip to the nearby Ha Nam Province. After learning about the infection cases at Bach Mai, the Ha Nam health sector isolated members of this team. After she tested Covid - 19 positive, she was admitted to Ha Nam General Hospital for treatment. She takes the number of patients linked to the Bach Mai Hospital to 43, 27 of whom are employees of the Truong Sinh Company. The other five patients are people quarantined on arrival from abroad. Patients 228, 229 and 230 returned to Vietnam on March 20 and were quarantined in the northern province of Ninh Binh. Further details of their flights home have not been revealed. ""Patient 228"" is a 29 - year - old man from the northern province of Bac Giang now undergoing treatment at a medical center in Ninh Binh Province's Ninh Thang Commune, Hoa Lu District. ""Patient 229"" and ""Patient 230,"" women aged 30 and 28 respectively, are from the central province of Ha Tinh who have been admitted to the Ninh Binh General Hospital for treatment."
20,"Patients ""232"" and ""233"" flew back to Vietnam March 27 on Aeroflot flight SU290 from Moscow and were quarantined in the northern province of Vinh Phuc. They are being treated at the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi's Dong Anh District. ""Patient 232"" is a 67 - year - old man from the southern province of Ba Ria - Vung Tau and ""Patient 233"" is a 24 - year - old woman from Nghe An Province in central Vietnam. Of the 233 cases of new coronavirus infection confirmed in Vietnam until now, 75 have been discharged from hospitals. Vietnam declared Covid - 19 a national epidemic Wednesday afternoon. To date, the Covid - 19 pandemic has claimed almost 53,000 lives in 204 countries and territories. No person coming from any area that has experienced a Covid - 19 outbreak will be allowed to enter Vietnam, the PM directed Tuesday. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to apply the new policy to South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran and all other countries and territories that have reported cases of Covid - 19 caused by the novel coronavirus. Vietnam has so far achieved positive results in fighting the Covid - 19, but the epidemic has entered its next stage, spreading to many other parts of the world and is now developing complicatedly and unpredictably in South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran, the PM noted."
21,"For those who have to enter Vietnam for state affairs or exclusive matters, the government requests them to follow the nation's health declaration procedure and stay in quarantine for 14 days. Citizens of countries stricken by Covid - 19, but from cities / provinces free of the epidemic, will have to submit a health declaration and submit to further procedures deemed necessary when entering Vietnam. Vietnamese citizens from China's epidemic hit areas can return home, but only via international border gates and will have to be quarantined for two weeks on entry, continuing the policy being followed for the past month. For its part, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on all Vietnamese citizens not to travel to affected areas and if such travel is unavoidable, they have to be quarantined on return. Vietnamese expatriates in epidemic - hit areas have been told to strictly follow regulations and guidance of the local authorities; and advised not to return to Vietnam at this time. Deputy PM Vu Duc Dam had said earlier Tuesday that in order for the country to achieve the positive results it has so far, Vietnam had been proactively implementing measures to prevent and limit the epidemic from mid-December last year, as soon as reports appeared of the Covid - 19 in China's Wuhan City. Staring February 1, Vietnam had suspended all flights to and from China and stopped granting tourist visas to Chinese from epidemic - stricken areas. After South Korea raised its disease alert to the 'highest level,' the Vietnamese government has tightened controls for visitors from that country."
22,"Starting Monday, everyone coming in from South Korea has to make health declarations, and those with symptoms like high fever, coughing and breathing difficulties will be placed in quarantine for a minimum of 14 days. Now all flights from infected areas in South Korea will be diverted to smaller airports â€“ Van Don in the northern Quang Ninh Province, Phu Cat in the south central Binh Dinh Province and Can Tho in the Mekong Delta. Saigon and Da Nang are currently quarantining 83 people coming on Monday from South Korea's Daegu City, where a major coronavirus outbreak has been detected. Some South Koreans who refused to be quarantined has flown home late Tuesday night. South Korea is making headlines internationally as one of the worst - hit countries and territories by the coronavirus epidemic, recording 977 infections by Tuesday evening, second only to China. As of Tuesday, the last of the 16 infection novel coronavirus infections detected so far in Vietnam had fully recovered. Over the past 13 days, no new infection case has been reported in the country. The Covid - 19 is affecting 39 countries and territories. Death toll has crossed 2,700, mostly in China, followed by Iran with 15, South Korea with 11 and Italy with seven. Floods kill runner of Dalat Ultra Trail 2020 A runner of the Ultra Trail 2020 international marathon, which is taking place in the Central Highlands city of Dalat, was found dead this afternoon, June 20 after he was swept away by floodwaters triggered by downpours."
23,"The victim, identified as Thai Don Thanh, was running across a section of the Golden Stream in Lac Duong District's Da Sal Commune when the 40 - year - old resident of HCMC met with the accident, Sai Gon Giai Phong news site reported. The government of Lac Duong District told Tuoi Tre Online that due to the heavy rain on the same day, floodwater levels rose sharply, while the runners were competing in the rain. After the accident had occurred, the organizers of the marathon suspended the competition and used vehicles to transport runners back to the starting point. Over 6,200 local and foreign runners are joining the Dalat Ultra Trail 2020. Japan is now testing a robot cooking soba noodles at Tokyo station It is JR East startup Co., Ltd., that has run an experiment on a robot cooking soba noodles for train passengers at Tokyo station recently. The robot, put at Higashi - Koganei Station on Railway Co. 's Chuo Line, is capable of making 40 soba dishes an hour, about the same as a cook's performance. The robot takes charge of boiling the noodles while the staffs take charge of putting them on a plate and giving them to the customer. Based on the information from the East Japan Railway Company, the trial period might be extended to April 15 with the aim to determine whether the robot can work well enough and satisfy the expectations of its noodle - loving customers or not."
24,"According to a staff, by virtue of the robot, it is possible to beat the kitchen heat in the summer as well as the risk of burning from scalding noodle water. Besides, while the robot boils up noodles, the chef is given an opportunity to have time to do something else, such as dealing with customers, cooking fried food and clearing away dishes. Imagine an airplane flying one millimeter above the ground and circling the Earth once every 25 seconds while counting every blade of grass. Shrink all that down so that it fits in the palm of your hand, and you'd have something equivalent to a modern hard drive, an object that can likely hold more information than your local library. So how does it store so much information in such a small space? At the heart of every hard drive is a stack of high - speed spinning discs with a recording head flying over each surface. Each disc is coated with a film of microscopic magnetised metal grains, and your data does n't live there in a form you can recognize. Instead, it is recorded as a magnetic pattern formed by groups of those tiny grains. In each group, also known as a bit, all of the grains have their magnetization's aligned in one of two possible states, which correspond to zeroes and ones. Data is written onto the disc by converting strings of bits into electrical current fed through an electromagnet. This magnet generates a field strong enough to change the direction of the metal grain's magnetization."
25,"Once this information is written onto the disc, the drive uses a magnetic reader to turn it back into a useful form, much like a phonograph needle translates a record's grooves into music. But how can you get so much information out of just zeroes and ones? Well, by putting lots of them together. For example, a letter is represented in one byte, or eight bits, and your average photo takes up several megabytes, each of which is 8 million bits. Because each bit must be written onto a physical area of the disc, we're always seeking to increase the disc's areal density, or how many bits can be squeezed into one square inch. The area density of a modern hard drive is about 600 gigabits per square inch, 300 million times greater than that of IBM's first hard drive from 1957. This amazing advance in storage capacity was n't just a matter of making everything smaller, but involved multiple innovations. A technique called the thin film lithography process allowed engineers to shrink the reader and writer. And despite its size, the reader became more sensitive by taking advantage of new discoveries in magnetic and quantum properties of matter. Bits could also be packed closer together thanks to mathematical algorithms that filter out noise from magnetic interference, and find the most likely bit sequences from each chunk of read - back signal."
26,"And thermal expansion control of the head, enabled by placing a heater under the magnetic writer, allowed it to fly less than five nanometers above the disc's surface, about the width of two strands of DNA. For the past several decades, the exponential growth in computer storage capacity and processing power has followed a pattern known as Moore's Law, which, in 1975, predicted that information density would double every two years. But at around 100 gigabits per square inch, shrinking the magnetic grains further or cramming them closer together posed a new risk called the superparamagnetic effect. When a magnetic grain volume is too small, its magnetization is easily disturbed by heat energy and can cause bits to switch unintentionally, leading to data loss. Scientists resolved this limitation in a remarkably simple way: by changing the direction of recording from longitudinal to perpendicular, allowing areal density to approach one terabit per square inch. Recently, the potential limit has been increased yet again through heat assisted magnetic recording. This uses an even more thermally stable recording medium, whose magnetic resistance is momentarily reduced by heating up a particular spot with a laser and allowing data to be written. And while those drives are currently in the prototype stage, scientists already have the next potential trick up their sleeves: bit-patterned media, where bit locations are arranged in separate, nano - sized structures, potentially allowing for areal densities of twenty terabits per square inch or more."
27,"So it's thanks to the combined efforts of generations of engineers, material scientists, and quantum physicists that this tool of incredible power and precision can spin in the palm of your hand. Little do they know it, but these six creatures are each about to experience a very unusual death. a carnivorous plant. Around the world there are more than 600 plant species that supplement a regular diet of sunlight, water, and soil with insects, microbes, or even frogs and rats. Scientists believe that carnivory in plants evolved separately at least six times on our planet, suggesting that this flesh - munching adaptation holds a major benefit for plants. Carnivorous plants tend to grow in places with highly acidic soil, which is poor in crucial nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In these hostile conditions, plants that are able to lure, trap, and digest prey have an advantage over those that rely on soil for their nutrients. Take this inhospitable bog, where pitcher plants reign supreme. Drawn to the pitcher's vivid colors and alluring scent, the fly closes in and slurps its nectar. But this pitcher species has an ingredient called coniine in its nectar, a powerful narcotic to insects. As the coniine takes effect, the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, and falls down the funnel into a pool of liquid at the base, where he drowns. Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly break his body down into microscopic particles the pitcher plant can consume through its leaves. Occasionally, larger prey also tumbles into the fatal funnel of the pitcher plant."
28,"The second victim faces off with the sticky sundew plant. The sundew's tiny leaves are equipped with a viscous secretion called mucilage. The ant is swiftly trapped in this goo. As she struggles, enzymes begin to digest her body. Special tentacles sense her movement and curl around her, clenching her in their suffocating grip. Once she asphyxiates, which can happen in under an hour, the tentacles unfurl again to snare their next victim. Two down, four to go. The next target meets his end underground, in the coils of the corkscrew plant. He enters the roots through a tiny slit in search of food. But inside, he quickly loses his way through the tangled labyrinth. A forest of curved hairs prevents his escape, guiding him into a central chamber with flesh - digesting enzymes and deadly low levels of oxygen. In the murky depths of a nearby pond, a tadpole unwittingly swims into the path of the bladderwort, the speediest of all carnivorous plants. She treads on the bladderwort's trigger, and in milliseconds, a trapdoor swings open and sucks her in. Trapped half in and half out, she struggles to free herself while the part of her body inside the plant gets digested. Over the next few hours, her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly, each time bringing her deeper into the plant to be digested alive bit by bit. Meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by sweet - smelling nectar. The scent draws him closer and closer until he lands on the leaves of the world's most infamous carnivorous plant."
29,"His landing triggers tiny hairs on the surface of the leaves, and the jaws of the venus fly trap snap shut around him. The spikes interlock to seal his fate. Once closed, the leaves act like an external stomach that digests the beetle's soft tissues. When they open again a few days later, only the dry husk of his exoskeleton remains. The mayfly is the last creature standing. As she approaches the butterwort plant, she heads for the flowers that wave high above the plant's globs of adhesive goo. She alights on the petals, drinks the nectar, and takes off unscathed. These long flower stalks keep certain insects away from the carnivore's traps - a way of separating pollinators from food. Off the mayfly buzzes to live a long and fruitful life â€“ oh. So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online, experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools. And in my job at Twitter, I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well, helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with. And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction. But I want to start and go back to the 1930s. Long before a little thing called Twitter, radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast. And from those single points emanated stories."
30,"Some of them were familiar stories. Some of them were new stories. And for a while they were familiar formats, but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium. Think about episodes that happened live on radio. Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction, you get this new format. And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories. And of course, today, we have an entirely new medium to play with, which is this online world. This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them. There are thousands upon thousands of them. Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster. We've gone to this world of many to many, where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting. And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium. I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation, if you will, that we've explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it, and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create. I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods."
